Little cms is a small, speed optimized color management engine.

This is lcms2, the new version of the lcms library.  It is safe to
install it alongside the version of lcms in Slackware-13.37.

lcms2 is included in Slackware-current since April 14, 2012, so, if
you are running -current, you should probably use the official package
instead of this one.
