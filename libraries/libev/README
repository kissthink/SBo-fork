libev (a high-performance event loop/model)

Libev is modelled (very loosely) after libevent and the Event perl
module, but is faster, scales better and is more correct, and also
more featureful. And also smaller. Yay.

Note: libev and libevent both have a usr/include/event.h 
header file. This could lead to compile problems if both 
packages are installed at the same time.
