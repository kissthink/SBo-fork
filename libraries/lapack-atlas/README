LAPACK provides routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear
equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations,
eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.

This script builds LAPACK against ATLAS. As such it requires ATLAS as installed
by the appropriate SlackBuild. This build conflicts with the lapack.SlackBuild
but you may try to have both installed if you definitely want, see below.

Do read over README.SLACKWARE *before* building this.

NOTE: The download link provides a package with lapack-3.3.1 patched against
some of the presently known bugs of the 3.3.1 release. Please consult the
LAPACK-3.3.1 errata file (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/Errata/index2.html) for
more details about the corrected bugs.
