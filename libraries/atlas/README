ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) is an  ongoing
research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in order to
provide portable performance. At present, it provides C and Fortran77
interfaces to a portably efficient BLAS implementation, as well as a few
routines from LAPACK.

This conflicts with cblas (only one of atlas and cblas may be installed 
at any given time).  Take care with LAPACK (see notes 3 & 4 in
README.SLACKWARE).

You need to read over README.SLACKWARE *before* building this.
