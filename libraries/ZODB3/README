The Zope Object Database provides an object-oriented database for
Python that provides a high-degree of transparency.  Applications
can take advantage of object database features with few, if any,
changes to application logic.  ZODB includes features such as a
plugable storage interface, rich transaction support, and undo.

This requires zope.event, python-transaction, zc.lockfile, ZConfig,
zdaemon, zope.interface and zope.proxy.

To build, this requires pysetuptools.
