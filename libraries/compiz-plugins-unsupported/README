The plugins in the Plugins Unsupported package are freely available for users
to try, but they are not supported. Most of them offer miscellaneous eye candy
or special utilities, but they are either quick demonstrations with few
features, or likely to have bugs.

 1. compiz-bcop
 2. protobuf (optional but recommended)
 3. libcompizconfig
 4. compizconfig-python
 5. compizconfig-backend-kconfig4 (optional)

 7. compiz-plugins-main
 8. compiz-plugins-extra (optional)
