LibFM provides file management functions built on top of Glib/GIO, 
giving a convenient higher-level API.

This requires menu-cache.
udisks and upower are needed for automounting removable media.
If libfm is built over gvfs, it will use its supported access
methods for local and remote data (trash, ftp, smb, etc.).
