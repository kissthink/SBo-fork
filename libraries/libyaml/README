libyaml is C library for parsing and emitting YAML 1.1.  The library is
required by Ruby 1.9.2 and above.

YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that takes concepts
from programming languages such as C, Perl, and Python, and ideas from
XML and the data format of electronic mail.  YAML syntax was designed to
be easily mapped to data types common to most high-level languages:
list, associative array, and scalar.
