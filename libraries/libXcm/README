The libXcm library contains the a reference implementation of the net-color
spec. The net-color spec allows to attach colour regions to X windows to 
communicate with colour servers.

The XcmDDC API can be used to fetch a EDID data block from a monitor over a
i2c communication. On Linux typical the i2c-dev module must be loaded to
use this hardware data channel. The device nodes must obtain rights
accessible to normal users.

The XcmEdidParse API is for parsing EDID data blocks. A small example 
application is included.

The XcmEvents API allowes to easily observe X11 colour management events.
The included xcmsevents makes use of the XcmEvents API.
