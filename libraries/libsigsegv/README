libsigsegv is a library for handling page faults in user mode. A page fault
occurs when a program tries to access to a region of memory that is
currently not available.

NOTE:
This overwrites /usr/include/sigsegv.h from clisp (included in Slackware),
but that should not cause any problems, as they are exactly the same.
