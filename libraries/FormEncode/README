FormEncode validates and converts nested structures.  It allows for a
declarative form of defining the validation, and decoupled processes
for filling and generating forms.

NOTE: To build this package, setuptools needs to be installed
(available at SlackBuilds.org as "pysetuptools").  Also, Sphinx, if
installed, is used to generate the docs.

NOTE: Running the test suite requires nose.
