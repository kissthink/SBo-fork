Gecko Mediaplayer is the modern replacement for the mplayerplug-in
application.

It is a browser plugin that uses GNOME MPlayer to play media in a browser.
It should work with all browsers (including Chrome) on Unix-ish systems
(Linux, BSD, Solaris) and uses the NS4 API (Mozilla, Firefox, Opera, etc.).

Either dconf or gconf is required for the program to save settings.  They
are no longer stored in a .conf file.  If you plan to use gconf pass
        GCONF=YES
to the script.

gnome-mplayer is required to use this software.  xulrunner (at SBo) or
seamonkey (included in Slackware) is required to build it.

If you choose to build against seamonkey, note:  Due to some missing
seamonkey headers in the current seamonkey package, seamonkey 2.0x from
Slackware 13.1 must be installed for gecko-mediaplayer to build and run
properly.
