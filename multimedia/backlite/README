backlite provides several tools for backing up DVDs, including DVD9 to
DVD5 conversion.  

This is the Qt-only version of the KDE DVD backup utility K9Copy.

This requires libmpeg2 and ffmpeg.

Additional (optional) runtime deps are libdvdcss (for DVD Backup action)
along with mjpegtools and twolame (for DVD Author action).
