All the official MythTV plugins, including MythArchive,
MythGallery, MythGame, MythMusic, MythNews, MythVideo,
MythWeather, and MythWeb.

This requires mythtv, pycurl, urlgrabber dcraw, perl-XML-XPath,
perl-Image-Size, perl-DateTime-Format-ISO8601, libcdaudio, dvdauthor,
python-oauth and lame.

Some of these plugins require extra work to get them functional.  See the
README files in /usr/doc/mythplugins for extra steps, configuration, and
dependencies.
