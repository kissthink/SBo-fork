Exaile is a music manager and player for GTK+ written in Python. It
incorporates automatic fetching of album art, handling of large libraries,
lyrics fetching, artist/album information via Wikipedia, and Last.fm
submission support.

This requires gst-python and mutagen.

Optional dependencies are gst-plugins-ugly (for mp3 support), cddb-py (for
audio CD playback), gst-gnome-vfs (for SHOUTcast support), webkit,
pywebkitgtk (for contextual informations about the track) and streamripper
(to record streams).
