flash-player-plugin (flash plugin for web browsers)

Adobe's versioning (or lack thereof) and lack of consistency between
the 32bit and 64bit flashplayer builds is maddening.  I know that 
the way I've handled it is suboptimal, but absent some very compelling
reason to change, that's the way it will remain.  Complain to Adobe.
