dvd-slideshow is a group of Linux commandline programs that creates a
slideshow-style dvd from groups of pictures. Slideshow videos can be
made from a directory or some online photo albums. You can add fancy
effects like fades, titles, and the Ken Burns effect along with audio
to make your slideshows even nicer.
