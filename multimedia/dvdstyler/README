DVDStyler is a cross-platform free DVD authoring application for the
creation of professional-looking DVDs. It allows not only burning of
video files on DVD that can be played practically on any standalone DVD
player, but also creation of individually designed DVD menus.

This requires dvdauthor, ffmpeg, libavc1394, libmspack, libquicktime,
mjpegtools, mpgtx, (wxPython or wxGTK) and wxsvg.  Note that wxPython /
wxGTK need to have been built with the media library.
