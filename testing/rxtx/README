RXTX is a Java library providing serial and parallel port communication.

Note: this is an obsolete version of RXTX intended for use with JMRI
(available at SlackBuilds.org).  It is not necessarily suitable for use
with other applications.

To build RXTX requires the jdk package (available in Slackware's extra/
directory) and javacomm (available at SlackBuilds.org).  To run RXTX
requires javacomm but not jdk.
