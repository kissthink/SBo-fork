autopano-sift-C is a C port of the C# software autopano-sift. 
It automatically creates control points for groups of overlapping 
photographs.  Additionally, autopano-sift-C has experimental 
modifications to perform feature identification in conformal image space.

This requires libpano13, available at SlackBuilds.org.
