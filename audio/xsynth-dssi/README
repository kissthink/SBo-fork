xsynth-dssi (software synthesizer)

Xsynth-DSSI plugin, a classic-analog (VCOs-VCF-VCA) style software
synthesizer with an editor GUI. Xsynth-DSSI was written by Sean Bolton,
and was based on Steve Brooke's Xsynth code, but has since aquired
polyphonic operation, band-limited oscillators, a better filter mode,
and velocity-sensitive envelopes.

This requires dssi, ladspa_sdk, jack-audio-connection-kit, and liblo.
