jack-keyboard (virtual MIDI keyboard)

jack-keyboard is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that allows you to
send JACK MIDI events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard. It's somewhat
similar to vkeybd, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA, and the
default keyboard mapping is much better - it uses the same layout as
trackers (like Impulse Tracker) did, so you have two and half octaves
under your fingers.
