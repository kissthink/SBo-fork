Fluid General MIDI SoundFont

This is a GM SoundFont, for use with any modern MIDI synthesiser: hardware
(like the emu10k1 sound card), or software (like FluidSynth).

This package includes a shell script wrapper "fluidplay" that runs
fluidsynth (if it's installed) with this SoundFont pre-loaded.

This package can also be used with TiMidity++.  See README.timidity in
the documentation directory.
