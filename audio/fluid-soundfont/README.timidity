The SlackBuilds.org fluid-soundfont package includes a config
file to use the SoundFont with TiMidity++. To enable, create an
/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg containing the following line of text:

source /etc/timidity/fluid.cfg

If you already have a /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg, delete it first,
or move it out of the way.
