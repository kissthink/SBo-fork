guitarix is a simple Linux Rock Guitar Amplifier for jack (Jack Audio
Connection Kit) with one input and two outputs. Designed to get nice
thrash/metal/rock/blues guitar sounds. There are controls for bass, middle,
treble, gain (in/out), compressor, preamp, tube's, drive, overdrive,
oversample, e.t.c.

This requires jack, ladspa_sdk, and gtkmm.
meterbridge is an optional runtime dep.
