alsa-tools includes card-specific tools for various soundcards,
including firmware loaders for pcmcia and USB devices.

This package includes the firmware as well as the loaders (so there's
no need for a separate alsa-firmware package like Debian has).

This build includes udev rules for the Tascam US-122, US-224, and US-428
USB audio interfaces (which replace the old hotplug scripts shipped
with the alsa-tools source). Also included is the SlackBuild author's
"tascam-us122-HOWTO" document (see /usr/doc/alsa-tools-$VERSION).

Included tools:

ac3dec - simple AC3 stream decoder
as10k1 - assembler for the emu10k1 DSP chip present in Creative soundcards
cspctl - Sound Blaster 16 ASP/CSP control program
dl10k1 - loads dumps previously created with lo10k1 & ld10k1
echomixer - Linux equivalent of the Echoaudio console application
envy24control - Control tool for Envy24 (ice1712) based soundcards
extract_ac3 - extract AC3 streams from VOB files
hdspconf - GUI to control the Hammerfall HDSP Alsa Settings
hdsploader - firmware loader for the RME Hammerfall DSP cards
hdspmixer - Linux equivalent of the Totalmix application from RME
hwmixvolume - hardware mixer control for cards using hardware mixing
init_audigy, init_audigy_eq10, init_live - initialize Creative cards
ld10k1 - dump patches stored in an EMU10K1/EMU10K2 card
ld10k1d - daemon for lo10k1
lo10k1 - EMU10K1 (EMU10K2) patch loader for ALSA
mixartloader - Firmware loader for Digigram miXart soundcards
pcxhrloader - Firmware loader for Digigram pcxhr compatible soundcards
qlo10k1 - GUI for loading patches on EMU10K1/EMU10K2 cards
rmedigicontrol - control tool for RME Digi32 and RME Digi96 soundcards
sbiload - OPL2/3 FM instrument loader for ALSA hwdep
sscape_ctl - ALSA SoundScape control utility
us428control - Tascam US-428 control surface daemon
usx2yloader - 2nd Phase Firmware loader for Tascam USX2Y USB soundcards
vxloader - Firmware loader for Digigram VX soundcards

One of the tools (qlo10k1) uses Qt3. If you need this tool, install qt3,
and pass QT3=yes in the environment for alsa-tools.SlackBuild.

This requires fltk.
