SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio 
synthesis and algorithmic composition.  It provides an interpreted object
oriented language which functions as a network client to a state of the art, 
realtime sound synthesis server.

This buildscript also includes SwingOSC which is a GUI Framework for
Supercollider.

This requires scons, icu4c, and jack-audio-connection-kit.
