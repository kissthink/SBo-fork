foo-yc20 (Yamaha YC-20 organ emulator for JACK and LV2)

This is an implementation of a 1969 designed Yamaha combo organ,
the YC-20.

Original YC-20 organs have a touch vibrato control, which is vibrato
induced by horizontal movement of the keys. As there very few (almost
none) midi keyboards which produce such information, this feature has
been left out of the emulation. Instead of the touch vibrato control,
the control panel hosts a "realism" switch.

By default, the package is built with -march=native, which tells gcc
to use the host CPU's features such as SSE2. You can disable this by
passing FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes to the script.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
