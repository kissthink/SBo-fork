Sonic Visualiser is an application for viewing and analysing the contents
of music audio files. The aim of Sonic Visualiser is to be the first
program you reach for when want to study a musical recording rather than
simply listen to it.

This requires ladspa_sdk, vamp-plugin-sdk, rubberband, and liblrdf.
Also, one (or both) of either jack-audio-connection-kit or portaudio is
required for audio playback.

Note to x86_64 users: if sonic-visualiser can't seem to find
any VAMP plugins you've installed, you may have to 'export
VAMP_PATH=/usr/lib64/vamp'. The SBo vamp-plugin-sdk (v2.1, build
2) package at the time of this writing still defaults to using
/usr/lib/vamp. Future builds of vamp-plugin-sdk should address this.
