If you want to easily tag multiple MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, MP4/AAC,
MP2, Speex, TrueAudio and WavPack files (e.g. full albums) without typing
the same information again and again and have control over both ID3v1
and ID3v2 tags, then Kid3 is the program you are looking for.

This requires libmusicbrainz (2 or 3), libofa, libtunepimp, and id3lib.
mp4lib is an optional dependency.
