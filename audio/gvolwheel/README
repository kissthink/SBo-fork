GVolWheel is a Lightweight application which lets you control 
the audio volume easily through a tray icon you can scroll on. 
Easily integrates with minimal desktops (Openbox, IceWM, XFCE, 
etc).

GVolWheel is not the same as VolWheel. GVolWheel is written in C,
while VolWheel is written in Perl. This is the last Gtk2 version. 
Current (0.9+) requires Gtk3.
