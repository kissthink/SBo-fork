A handy audio recorder based on jack. Command line or GUI. Very low on
resources. Able to write 256 channels to local hard drive (tested on
iCore 7).

Meterbridge is a nice companion program (VU meters) unless you start
the program from console.

Optional runtime dependencies are meterbridge and lame.
