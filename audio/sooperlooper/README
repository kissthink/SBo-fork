SooperLooper is a live looping sampler capable of immediate loop
recording, overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more.  It allows 
for multiple simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your 
computer's available memory.

This requires jack-audio-connection-kit, liblo, rubberband, wxGTK or
wxPython, and libsigc++-legacy.
