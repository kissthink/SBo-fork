GRAMPS is a genealogy program for Linux and other UNIX-like systems. GRAMPS
stands for Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System.
GRAMPS helps you track your family tree.  It allows you to store, edit, and
research genealogical data.

GRAMPS requires ORBit2, libbonobo, gnome-mime-data, GConf, gnome-vfs,
libgnome, and gnome-python; building in that order should work.

GRAMPS can also use libgnomeprint, graphviz, inkscape, and freefont
if they are installed.
