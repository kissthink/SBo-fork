This is a fork of the SlackBuilds.org repository. 

The 'master' branch tracks SBo.

The 'fork' branch contains the following additional subdirectories:
  testing        beta versions of SBo SlackBuilds that I maintain
  upversioned    version bumps of other peoples' SlackBuilds
  bleedingedge   SlackBuilds to build the development branches of
                 various apps and libraries
  unmaintained   old SlackBuilds that may still be useful

See http://slackbuilds.org/howto/ for instructions on
