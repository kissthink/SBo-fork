This is a fork of the SlackBuilds.org repository. 

The 'master' branch tracks SBo.

The 'fork' branch contains the following additional subdirectories:
  Testing        beta versions of SBo SlackBuilds that I maintain
                 (note: when ready for submission to SBo they will
                 be copied to the relevant SBo subdirectory)
  Upversioned    version bumps of other peoples' SlackBuilds
  BleedingEdge   SlackBuilds to build the development branches of
                 various apps and libraries
  Unmaintained   old and obscure SlackBuilds that may still be useful

See http://slackbuilds.org/howto/ for instructions on 
how to use the contents of this repository.
