Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is
a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either 
greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the 
amount you learn.

Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit 
from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, 
videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.

This requires pysetuptools, SQLAlchemy, simplejson, numpy, matplotlib,
and BeautifulSoup

For audio recording support pyaudio and lame are required, but pyaudio
(http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) is not available yet on
SlackBuilds.org.
