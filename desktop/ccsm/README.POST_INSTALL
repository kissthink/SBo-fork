After you've installed the compiz-fusion packages you need to enable
a few key features before you launch compiz.
Launch "ccsm" and enable the following options:

 * Window Decorations
 * Move Window
 * Rezise Window

These options will allow you to manage your windows.
After enabled, you can launch compiz and customize to your liking.
