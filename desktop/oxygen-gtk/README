Oxygen-Gtk is a port of the default KDE widget theme (Oxygen) to gtk.

Its primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between gtk and
qt-based applications running under kde. A secondary objective is 
to also have a stand-alone nice looking gtk theme that would 
behave well on other Desktop Environments.

Unlike other attempts made to port the kde oxygen theme to gtk,
this attempt does not depend on Qt (via some Qt to Gtk conversion engine),
nor does render the widget appearance via hard coded pixmaps, 
which otherwise breaks everytime some setting is changed in kde.

EXAMPLE_USAGE:
    ln -s /usr/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-2.0/gtkrc ~/.gtkrc-2.0
