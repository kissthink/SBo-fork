The GNOME-Colors is a project that aims to make the desktop as elegant,
consistent and colorful as possible. The current goal is to allow full
color customization of themes, icons, GDM logins, and splash screens.
There are nine full color-schemes available; Noble (Purple),
Brave (Blue), Human (Orange), Wine (Red), Dust (Chocolate), Illustrious
(Pink), Wise (Green), Carbonite	(Dark-grow) and Tribute (Light-grow).
Shiki-Colors GTK themes can also be installed.

Edit /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc or create ~/.gtkrc-2.0 to change the default gtk
icon theme. There should be the string:
gtk-icon-theme-name = "gnome-$ThemeName", for example:
gtk-icon-theme-name = "gnome-dust"
