xmonad is a dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written
and configured in Haskell. In a normal WM, you spend half your time
aligning and searching for windows. xmonad makes work easier, by
automating this.

This requires ghc, haskell-utf8-string, haskell-transformers,
haskell-mtl, haskell-syb and haskell-X11.

After installing, use 'xwmconfig' command to reselect xmonad as window
manager, either as root to do system-wide selection or as normal user
to do user-specific selection.

To get you started, the most basic key bindings are:
	mod-shift-return   Launch xterm
	mod-shift-q        Quit xmonad
