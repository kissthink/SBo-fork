Avant Window Navigator (Awn)

Avant Window Navigator is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of
the screen. It has support for launchers, task lists, and third party
applets.

Requires libgtop, libdesktop-agnostic, GConf, ORBit2, and pyxdg.

In order to handle transparencies that this application makes use of,
you MUST use a composite desktop manager and, of course, enable
compositing.  Both KDE and XFCE from Slackware distro are composite
capable.
