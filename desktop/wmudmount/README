wmudmount is a (dockapp) filesystem mounter that uses udisks to handle
notification of new filesystems as a non-root user. It also includes
a mode to display the mounted filesystems with the least free space
percentage (similar to wmfsm).

This requires udisks and, optionally, gnome-keyring.

To compile with gnome-keyring this needs to be explicitly requested with:

KEYRING="YES" ./wmudmount.SlackBuild

Note that if you don't compile with gnome-keyring (default behavior) you
need to run wmudmount with the "--allow-insecure-memory" command line flag.
