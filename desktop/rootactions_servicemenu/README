Root Actions servicemenu provides a convenient way to perform several actions
'as root', from the right-click context menu in KDE filemanagers.

Included in the download are .desktop file versions for KDE3 konqueror,
KDE3 dolphin, KDE4 (both konqueror and dolphin), and an importable user 
action xml file for krusader KDE4.  See README in source files for details.

This build script installs the KDE4/Dolphin version.

NOTE: Starting with version 2.7.1 the KDE-Look package maintainer
removed the version number from the package name due to GHNS issues.
Please check the package md5sum before using the SlackBuild.
