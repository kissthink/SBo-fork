gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to
a host computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the
location, course, and velocity available to be queried on TCP port
2947 of the host computer.  With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications
(such as navigational and wardriving software) can share access to GPSes
without contention or loss of data.  Applications that presently use
gpsd include Viking and Kismet.

To build gpsd requires scons.

See README.build for some additional build options that might be useful.

To enable automatic startup of gpsd when a GPS device is connected via
USB, you need to perform the following three steps:

1. Edit the file /etc/udev/rules.d/97-gpsd.rules and uncomment the line
(or lines) beginning '#ATTRS' that corresponds to your GPS hardware.  To
avoid clashes with other USB serial devices that you might have, do not
uncomment lines that do not correspond to your GPS hardware.

2. Make the file /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd executable.
   chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd

3. Add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd -a -e /dev/gps0 ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd start
fi
