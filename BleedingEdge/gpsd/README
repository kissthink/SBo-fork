gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached to a 
host computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on the location, 
course, and velocity available to be queried on TCP port 2947 of the host 
computer.  With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications (such as navigational 
and wardriving software) can share access to GPSes without contention or 
loss of data.  Applications that presently use gpsd include Viking and Kismet.

To build gpsd requires scons.

See README.build for some additional build options that might be useful.

To enable automatic startup of gpsd on device hotplug (and coldplug), you need to 
perform the following three steps:

1. Edit the file /etc/udev/rules.d/25-gpsd.rules and uncomment the line (or lines) 
beginning '#ATTRS' that corresponds to your GPS hardware. 

2. Make the file /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd executable.
   chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd

3. Add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd ]; then
  if [ -e $(ls -1 /dev/gps* | head -1) ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.gpsd start
  fi
fi
