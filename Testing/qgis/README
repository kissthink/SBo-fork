Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a user friendly Geographic Information System
that runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows.  QGIS lets you browse
and create map data on your computer.  It supports many common spatial
data formats (e.g. ESRI ShapeFile, geotiff).

This requires proj, geos, gdal, gsl, numpy, and qwt.

Optional dependencies include grass, postgresql, postgis, and gpsbabel.

If you want to build the optional QGIS Server, you also need fcgi;
see README.server for more details.
