The Java Communications API (also known as javax.comm) is a Java extension
that provides access to RS-232 hardware (serial ports) and limited access
to IEEE-1284 hardware (parallel ports).

Note: this is an obsolete version of the Solaris implementation of Javacomm.
It is intended for use only with jmri.
It is not necessarily suitable for use with other applications.
