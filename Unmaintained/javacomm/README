The Java Communications API (also known as javax.comm) is a Java extension
that provides access to RS-232 hardware (serial ports) and limited access
to IEEE-1284 hardware (parallel ports).

Note: this is an obsolete version of the Solaris implementation of Javacomm.
It is intended for use only with JMRI (available at Slackbuilds.org).
It is not necessarily suitable for use with other applications.
