mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid, which starts
a sufficient number of instances of the CGI program to handle concurrent
requests, and these instances remain running to handle further incoming 
requests. 

To enable mod_fcgid, please add the following line to /etc/httpd/httpd.conf --
  Include /etc/httpd/extra/mod_fcgid.conf

http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/
