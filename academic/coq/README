Coq implements a program specification and mathematical higher-level
language called Gallina that is based on an expressive formal language
called the Calculus of Inductive Constructions that itself combines both
a higher-order logic and a richly-typed functional programming language.

This requires OCaml (>= 3.10.2), camlp5 (with "transitional mode", avoiding
version 5.0.0), and GNU Make (>= 3.81). If you have ocamlopt, Coq
will be compiled to native code, which runs 4-10 times faster. For best
performance, OCaml should have support for pthreads. 

Note: camlp5 6.01 appears to have a bug that prevents Coq from building
correctly. This build has been tested with 6.02.3.

If you want CoqIDE, you need LablGTK2 (>= 2.10.0) with development
files, and GTK2+ (>= 2.10.0).  This also REQUIRES OCaml to have support
for pthreads.

If you have emacs installed, emacs files for Coq will be installed.
Otherwise, they will be omitted.
