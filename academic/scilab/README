Scilab is an open source, cross-platform numerical computational
package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language.
It can be used for signal processing, statistical analysis, image
enhancement, fluid dynamics simulations, numerical optimization, and
modeling and simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems.
MATLAB code, which is similar in syntax, can be converted to Scilab.
Scilab is one of several open source alternatives to MATLAB.

If you want Scilab to use the system JVM instead of its own (and
eventually save about 100 MB of disk space), pass USE_SYSTEM_JVM=yes
to the script (default is "no"). Note: this may cause problems.
