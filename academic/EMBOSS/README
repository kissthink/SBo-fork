EMBOSS is "The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite". 

EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially 
developed for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user 
community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of 
formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from 
the web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided with the package, 
it is a platform to allow other scientists to develop and release 
software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of
currently available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a 
seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards commercial 
software packages.

If you want to use eprimer3 and multiple sequence alignment programs 
like emma, you should install primer3 and clustalw, both of which are 
available at SlackBuilds.org.
