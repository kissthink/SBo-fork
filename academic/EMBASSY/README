EMBASSY package includes applications with the same look and feel as 
EMBOSS applications, but which the author wishes to be kept separate 
from EMBOSS. This is usually because the packages are for specialised 
sequence analysis or for non-sequence based analysis, or are licensed 
differently to EMBOSS (i.e. non GPL).

EMBASSY includes the following applications:

- DOMAINATRIX
- DOMALIGN
- DOMSEARCH
- PHYLIP
- HMMER
- EMNU
- ESIM4
- MEME
- SIGNATURE
- STRUCTURE
- TOPO
- MSE
- VIENNA

This requires EMBOSS.
