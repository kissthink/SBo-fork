+Description: Displays and prints phylogenetic trees
+ TreeView X is an open source and multi-platform program to display
+ phylogenetic trees. It can read and display NEXUS and Newick format tree files
+ (such as those output by PAUP*, ClustalX, TREE-PUZZLE, and other programs). It
+ allows to order the branches of the trees, and to export the trees in SVG
+ format.
