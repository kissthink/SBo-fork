gElemental is a periodic table viewer that provides detailed info 
on the chemical elements. It is a port of GPeriodic to C++ and gtkmm. 
It offers an improved UI, an updated and corrected data set, a better 
data format, a list view and easier coloration. 

This requires glibmm and gtkmm, both of which are available at 
Slackbuilds.org.
