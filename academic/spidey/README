Spidey is an mRNA-to-genomic alignment program. For a complete 
description of how Spidey works, visit 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/spidey/spideydoc.html.

This is just repackaging of the ready binary for x86 and will not run 
on x86_64. It will probably work just fine on a Slackware multilib 
box, but we do not support that ;). If you want to build spidey from 
source, you should download and compile the NCBI toolkit. For more
