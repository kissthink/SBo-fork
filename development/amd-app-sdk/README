AMD APP (formerly ATI Stream) technology is a set of advanced hardware and
software technologies that enable AMD graphics processing cores (GPU),
working in concert with the system's x86 cores (CPU), to accelerate many
applications beyond just graphics.

This is AMD's implementation of OpenCL on top of Radeon hardware. You'll
need a compatible card and recent Catalyst drivers. See 
http://developer.amd.com/sdks/AMDAPPSDK/pages/DriverCompatibility.aspx 
for a complete list of requirements.

NOTE:

This package is compatible only with x86 and x86_64 architectures.
