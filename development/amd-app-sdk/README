AMD APP (formerly ATI Stream) technology is a set of advanced hardware and
software technologies that enable AMD graphics processing cores (GPU), working
in concert with the system's x86 cores (CPU), to accelerate many applications
beyond just graphics.

This is AMD's impementation of OpenCL on top of Radeon hardware. You'll need a
compatible card and recent Catalyst drivers. See 
http://developer.amd.com/sdks/AMDAPPSDK/pages/DriverCompatibility.aspx 
for a complete list of requirements.

NOTES:

This package is compatible only with x86 and x86_64 architectures.

The download links point to a license agreement page. If you agree to that
license, you'll then be able to download the files.
