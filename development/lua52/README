Lua is a free software light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
general-purpose, stand-alone scripting language.

* WARNING *
This package is just for the slackware users needing the 5.2.x
version: it is not compatible with the 5.1.x one (install
just one version of the two) and with most of the software
that needs lua on slackbuilds.org.
