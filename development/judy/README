judy (sparse dynamic array library)

Judy is a C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology
that implements a sparse dynamic array.
Judy arrays are declared simply with a null pointer.
A Judy array consumes memory only when it is populated, yet can grow
to take advantage of all available memory if desired.
Judy's key benefits are scalability, high performance, and memory
efficiency.
