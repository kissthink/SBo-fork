The Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) provides a plugin framework for 
distributing DMX512 control signals on Mac and Linux. It provides C++ 
and Python libraries which abstract away the underlying DMX over IP 
protocol or DMX interface. See http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA for 
more information. 

To disable the python libs 
run the script as follows:   WITH_PYTHON=no ./ola.SlackBuild

To disable the builtin http server (requires libmicrohttp) 
run the script as follows:   WITH_HTTP=no ./ola.SlackBuild

ola requires protobuf and cppunit.
