MLton is an open-source, whole-program, optimizing Standard ML compiler. It
aims to produce fast executables, and to encourage rapid prototyping and
modular programming by eliminating performance penalties often associated with
the use of high-level language features.

This is a prebuilt binary package to shorten overwhelmingly long time of local
compilation.
