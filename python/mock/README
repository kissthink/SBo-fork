mock implements a Mocking and Testing Library in Python

mock is a Python module that provides a core Mock class. It removes
the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite.
The mock module also provides a patch() decorator that handles
patching module and class level attributes within the scope of a
test, along with sentinel for creating unique objects.
mock is tested on Python versions 2.4-2.7 and Python 3.
