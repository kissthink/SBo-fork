LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major
office suites, and available on a variety of platforms. It is free
software and therefore free to download, use and distribute.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's)
distributed by The Document Foundation.  Everything needed by the
application should be built statically into it, so there aren't any
dependencies not satisfied by a normal installation.

Be sure to look at the script for some optional things you can do when
building.

NOTE: See the separate SlackBuild script for the language packs.

NOTE2: To keep LibreOffice installed concurrently with OpenOffice, run the
       included "open-libre-together.sh" script saved in the documentation
       directory of this package to patch the .desktop menu files.

NOTE3: LibreOffice versions change quite often. If the version for which
       this script was written is no longer available, look for it at:
       http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/old/stable/
       It will go there after the next release.
       You can also try building the newer version using:
       # VERSION="x.y.z" ./libreoffice.SlackBuild
       This *might* work, but upstream has a habit of changing the naming
       and structure of the files, etc. between versions, so: YMMV.
