mupdf is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics.
MuPDF renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of
a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page
on screen.
 
This requires jbig2dec and openjpeg.
