Qamus is a simple Qt dictionary program which supports the Xdxf standard
as well as a custom qlx format. Qamus provides incremental and fuzzy
searches.

Qamus also supports rule-based searching to match misspelt words. Search
rules are defined in a separate XML file. Sample rule (qrx) and dictionary
(qlx) files are installed to /usr/doc/qamus-VERSION).

The tre regexp matching library and the icu4c unicode library (both
available as SlackBuilds) are recommended but are not manditory.

ICU and tre library support can be disabled by passing ICU=no and TRE=no
to the Slackbuild.
