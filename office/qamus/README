Qamus is a simple Qt dictionary program which supports the Xdxf standard
as well as a custom qlx format. Qamus provides incremental and fuzzy
searches.

Qamus also supports rule-based searching to match misspelt words. Search
rules are defined in a separate XML file. Sample rule (qrx) and dictionary
(qlx) files are installed to /usr/doc/qamus-VERSION).

The tre regexp matching library is recommended but are not manditory.
tre library support can be disabled by passing TRE=no to the Slackbuild.
