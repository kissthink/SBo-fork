Ted is a lightweight Word-processor that uses the RTF-format. It supports 
multiple fonts and can print to PostScript printers. Ted is simple to use, 
is easily compiled.

Additional packages with spellcheckers for different languages exist and 
can be downloaded from the Ted homepage.

Ted can be compiled with different toolkits, which defaults to GTK. To
define another toolkit (Choices are GTK, MOTIF and QT), you can specify
this on the commandline:

TOOLKIT=MOTIF ./Ted.SlackBuild
