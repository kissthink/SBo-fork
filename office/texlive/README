TeXLive (TeXLive binaries, support files, docs, TeX formats)

This package contains the binaries, support files, documentation, TeX formats 
and packages, and other files required for the TeXLive TeX distribution.  
Included are input files for TeX, runtime configuration files, hyphenation 
tables, manpages, and the computer modern fonts.

The resulting package is over 1GB in size, and a lot of space is required
during the build process, so you might want to consider defining an 
alternate location for TMP and OUTPUT if you have small /tmp partition.

Note that this package is intended to completely replace (and then some) the
tetex packages in Slackware, so you'll need to remove tetex and tetex-doc
before installing TeXLive (but NOT before BUILDING it).

This requires libsigsegv.
