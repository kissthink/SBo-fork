etm is an acronym for Event and Task Manager. It provides a simple,
intuitive format for using plain text files to store data, a command line
interface for viewing stored information in a variety of convenient ways
and a cross-platform, wx(python)-based GUI for creating and modifying
items as well as viewing them. Displayed items can be grouped by date,
context, keyword or project and can be filtered in various ways.

If you get a codes.py error after running e.py for the first time,
open ~/.etc/rc and edit the encoding lines at the top of the file. Add
f.ex. UTF8 if that is your locale.
