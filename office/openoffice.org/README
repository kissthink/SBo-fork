OpenOffice.org is a full-featured open-source office suite that is compatible 
with all other major office software.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's) 
distributed by openoffice.org.  Everything needed by the application should 
be built statically into it, so there aren't any dependencies not satisfied 
by a normal installation.  A java runtime environment (jre) is suggested by 
openoffice.org, but it is not required (note that jre is part of a standard
installation of Slackware).

Be sure to look at the script for some optional things you can do when building.
