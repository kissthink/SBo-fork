OpenOffice.org is a full-featured open-source office suite that is compatible 
with all other major office software.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official binary (RPM's) 
distributed by openoffice.org.  Everything needed by the application should 
be built statically into it, so there aren't any dependencies not satisfied 
by a normal installation.  A java runtime environment (jre) is suggested by 
openoffice.org, but it is not required (note that jre can be installed
ing the jdk slackbuild provided by slackbuilds.org).

Be sure to look at the script for some optional things you can do when building.
