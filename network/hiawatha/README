Hiawatha (A secure and advanced webserver)

Hiawatha is a webserver for Unix and has been built with security
in mind. This resulted in a highly secure webserver, in both code
and features.

Hiawatha supports many web and HTTP features such as
CGI/FastCGI, HTTP authentication, virtual host support, request
pipelining, keep alive connections, URL rewriting and many more.

Notes:

  To build/use this package the users/groups 'hiawatha' and 'php-fcgi' are
  required. You can create them with:

  # groupadd -g 259 hiawatha
  # useradd -u 259 -g 259 -c "User for hiawatha" -d / -s /bin/false hiawatha

  # groupadd -g 260 php-fcgi
  # useradd -u 260 -g 260 -c "User for php-fcgi" -d / -s /bin/false php-fcgi

  By default:

  * hiawatha daemon is going to be listening in the network interface 127.0.0.1:80
    and php-fcgi daemon will create the unix socket /var/run/hiawatha/php-fcgi.sock

  * The web root directory is /srv/hiawatha with index.html being
    the default start file.

  * hiawatha daemon can write temporary files inside /var/lib/hiawatha
