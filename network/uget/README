Uget (formerly urlgfe) is a Free and Open Source download manager.

It allows for queuing downloads, file type-based classification of
downloads, and is lightweight.

Optionally, uget can be compiled with support for aria2. This is
autodetected at build time. You can forcibly disable aria2 support by
setting ARIA2=no in the environment.
