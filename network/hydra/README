Hydra (A very fast network login cracker)

One of the biggest security holes are user passwords, as every
password security study shows. This tool is a proof of concept,
to give researchers and security consultants a way to demonstrate
how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a remote system.
           THIS TOOL IS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES ONLY!

This requires libssh (not libssh2).  postgresql is optional, as is
sap, but sap is not available at SlackBuilds.org.

This SlackBuild includes an option to omit the GTK-based frontend xhydra.
To omit xhydra, just pass XHYDRA=0 to the script:
    XHYDRA=0 sh hydra.SlackBuild

See the README installed in /usr/doc/hydra-7.2 for more info, or visit the
website:

NOTE:
There is a utility, dpl4hydra.sh, that is installed in the documentation
directory in this SlackBuild due to it being somewhat broken.
