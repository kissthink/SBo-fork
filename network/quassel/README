quassel (A cross platform IRC client)

quassel is based on qt4 platform. quassel core connects to
servers and quassel client connects to quassel core over
the internet. It means you can retain your IRC sessions even if
your X session is blowed up. multiple clients can attach to and
detach from a central core. It's like a combination of GNU screen
with such console IRC clients as weechat, bitchX, and irssi.

webkit is optional.
