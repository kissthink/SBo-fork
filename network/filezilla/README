FileZilla Client is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS and
SFTP client with lots of useful features and an intuitive graphical user
interface.

This requires either wxGTK (2.8.12 or higher) or wxPython.

tinyxml is an optional dependency - to use an installed version of tinyxml,
run the script as "TINYXML=yes ./filezilla.SlackBuild" - otherwise, the
build will use an included copy of tinyxml.
