By default this SlackBuild is going to build a dynamically linked skype
package, but in some cases a staticly linked one might be preferred.

First, get the skype_static tarball from here:

http://download.skype.com/linux/skype_static-2.2.0.35.tar.bz2
(md5sum: d948b8f04ad27b92297a99bcacc7b00b)

Then run skype.SlackBuild like this:
  STATIC=yes ./skype.SlackBuild

Enjoy :-)
