LOIQ - the Low Orbit Ion Cannon in Qt4

LOIQ is an open source network attack application, similar to LOIC, but written
in C++ and Qt4. LOIQ performs a denial-of-service (DoS) attack (or when used by
multiple individuals, a DDoS attack) on a target site by flooding the server
with TCP packets, UDP packets, or HTTP requests with the intention of disrupting
the service of a particular host.

icoutils is an optional dependency for icon generation during the build process.
