Liferea is an aggregator for online news feeds.  There are many other news 
readers available, but these others are not available for Linux or require 
many extra libraries to be installed.  Liferea tries to fill this gap by 
creating a fast, easy to use, easy to install news aggregator for GTK/GNOME.

Optional libindicate support can be enabled with
  INDICATE=yes ./liferea.SlackBuild

This requires GConf, webkitgtk, libunique and json-glib.
