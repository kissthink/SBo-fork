Mosh is a remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports 
intermittent connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line 
editing of user keystrokes.

Mosh attempts to improve on SSH by being more robust and responsive, 
especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.

Mosh requires a little tweaking after first install on Slackware. Both 
the Mosh server and client applications must be run with a UTF-8 locale, 
which is not Slackware's default.

Mosh depends on protobuf and perl-IO-Tty.
