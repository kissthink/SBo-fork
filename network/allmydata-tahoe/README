Tahoe-LAFS is a secure, decentralized, data store. All of the source code is
available under a choice of two Free Software, Open Source licences. This
filesystem is encrypted and spread over multiple peers in such a way that it
remains available even when some of the peers are unavailable, malfunctioning,
or malicious.

numpy is an optional runtime dependency.

For more information see running.rst in the docs folder.
