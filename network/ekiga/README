Ekiga (formely known as GnomeMeeting) is an open source VoIP and
video conferencing application for GNOME. Ekiga uses both the H.323
and SIP protocols. It supports many audio and video codecs, and is
interoperable with other SIP compliant software and also with
Microsoft NetMeeting.

This package will be built without gnome support. This breaks the
Help button, which probably needs the Gnome help system.

The following options, all disabled by default, are supported. Just
set any of them to "yes" to enable the corresponding feature:
- AVAHI (requires avahi)
- KDE (experimental KDE support)
- KAB (experimental KAddressBook support)
- GS (experimental GStreamer support)

Ekiga requires GConf, libsigc++, ptlib, and opal.

Note that this version has gconf enabled by default. To copy your
old contacts over to the gconf xml file from .config/ekiga.conf is
fairly trivial.

The gconf file is located at:
~/.gconf/apps/ekiga/contacts/%gconf.xml and you need to copy all
between the &lt;list&gt; and &lt;/list&gt;

You _must_ kill /usr/libexec/gconfd-2 process _before_ doing this.
