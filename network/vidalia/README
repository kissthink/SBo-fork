Vidalia is a GUI for Tor. Using Vidalia, you can start and stop Tor,
view its status at a glance, and monitor bandwidth usage.
Vidalia also makes it easy to contribute to the Tor network by helping
you set up and manage your own relay.

See README.SBo (which is also installed with the package docs) for some
configuration hints, and how to make use of MaxMind's GeoIP database.

If you don't plan to use MaxMind's GeoIP database, pass GEOIP=no to
the script.
