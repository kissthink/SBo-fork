mod_fastcgi is an Apache module which provides support for the FastCGI
protocol.  FastCGI is a language independent, scalable, open extension
to CGI that provides high performance and persistence without the
limitations of server specific APIs.

You will need to add the following line to /etc/httpd/httpd.conf:
  LoadModule fastcgi_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_fastcgi.so

See /usr/doc/mod_fastcgi-2.4.6/mod_fastcgi.html for configuration
details.
