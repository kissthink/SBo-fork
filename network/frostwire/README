Frostwire is a cross-platform, open-source peer-to-peer filesharing client
for the Gnutella and BitTorrent protocols.  It is written in Java and is a
fork of Limewire that includes all of the free LimeWire version's
functionality, plus a few features of LimeWire Pro's fee based upgrades.
FrostWire also provides a chatroom.

This is a repackaging of the official java binary from frostwire.com.
