Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) used on Unix-like operating systems.
It is freely available under the GNU GPL and it aims to be a general
and flexible mailer with extensive facilities for checking incoming e-mail.

Exim was orginally written by Philip Hazel for use in the University
of Cambridge Computing Services e-mail systems.

Before you can build Exim, you have to create an "exim" user and group:

    # groupadd -g 222 exim
    # useradd -d /var/spool/exim -g exim -s /bin/false -u 222 exim

The recommended uid/gid is 222, but others are fine if you prefer -
see http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt for other recommendations.

There's no "configure" script; instead Exim is configured by editing a well
documented Makefile, which is then included during the build process.  The
provided "exim.Makefile" will build an all-purpose Exim daemon with the
most common features.  The various database lookup methods will not be
built by default but can be enabled easily on the command line or by
editing a few lines in the Makefile.

Exim can be integrated with other email tools such as Clamav, Spamassassin,
Bogofilter, and others available at Slackbuilds.org.

WARNING: this package is intended as a drop-in replacement for Sendmail.
As a result, there are some inevitable filename conflicts between Sendmail
and Exim.  REMOVE SENDMAIL BEFORE INSTALLING THIS PACKAGE!

The SQL- and LDAP-lookups will not be built by default,
but you can enable them easily by passing the directives
on the command line when calling this script, e.g.

  LOOKUP_LDAP=yes LOOKUP_SQLITE=yes \
  LOOKUP_MYSQL=yes LOOKUP_PGSQL=yes \
  sh exim.SlackBuild
