# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ipv6calc: ipv6calc is a small utility written in programming language C to 
ipv6calc: manipulate (not only) IPv6 addresses. Intentions were convering a 
ipv6calc: given IPv6 address into compressed format, convering a given IPv6 
ipv6calc: address into the same format like shown in /proc/net/if_inet6 and 
ipv6calc: (because it was not difficulty) migrating the Perl program ip6_int 
ipv6calc: into. Now only one utiltity is needed to do a lot.

ipv6calc: This utility was also used in the past to extend features on 
ipv6calc: network-functions-ipv6 library, used by initscripts-ipv6.
