Zarafa offers a replacement for MS Exchange Server, providing
Outlook "Look & Feel" webaccess, integration with Linux mailservers,
mobile phone support, Outlook sharing (100% MAPI) etc.

This requires libvmime-zarafa, and zarafa-webaccess-ajax is needed
at runtime.

If you want to upgrade a zarafa 6.x.y database, you will need the
zarafa7-upgrade tool, which needs MySQL-python.
