Provides a monad-transformer version of the Control.Exception.catch
function.  For this, it defines the MonadCatchIO class, a subset of
MonadIO.  It defines proper instances for most monad transformers in
the mtl library.

This requires ghc, haskell-transformers, and haskell-mtl.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
