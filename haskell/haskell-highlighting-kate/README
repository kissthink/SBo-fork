highlighting-kate is a syntax highlighting library with support for
nearly one hundred languages.  The syntax parsers are automatically
generated from Kate syntax descriptions (http://kate-editor.org/),
so any syntax supported by Kate can be added.  A command-line
program is provided, along with a utility for generating new parsers
from Kate XML syntax descriptions.

This requires ghc, haskell-text, haskell-transformers,
haskell-blaze-builder, haskell-mtl, haskell-blaze-markup,
haskell-parsec, haskell-regex-base, haskell-blaze-html, and
haskell-regex-pcre-builtin.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
