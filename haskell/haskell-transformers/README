This part contains the monad transformer class, the concrete monad
transformers, operations and liftings.  It can be used on its own in
Haskell 98 code, or with the monad classes in the monads-fd or
monads-tf packages, which automatically lift operations introduced
by monad transformers through other transformers.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
