Allows tests such as QuickCheck properties and HUnit test cases to
be assembled into test groups, run in parallel (but reported in
deterministic order, to aid diff interpretation) and filtered and
controlled by command line options.  All of this comes with colored
test output, progress reporting and test statistics output.

This requires ghc, haskell-random, haskell-ansi-terminal,
haskell-hostname, haskell-transformers, haskell-xml,
haskell-ansi-wl-pprint, haskell-mtl, haskell-regex-base, and
haskell-regex-posix.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
