jfsw (source port of Shadow Warrior first-person shooter game)

The aim of this port is to present Shadow Warrior as closely as possible
to the original game while adding optional features to expand the
possibilities of the game.

To play the game, you will need the sw.grp data file from either the
full or shareware DOS version of Shadow Warrior. If you want to play the
shareware version, you can install jfsw_demo_data from slackbuilds.org.
For the full version, copy sw.grp from the game directory to
/usr/share/games/jfsw/sw.grp (the filename must be lowercase).

If you have sw.grp from the full version of the game, you may also want
to install jfsw_hires_pack for some graphic enhancements (don't bother
trying, if all you have is the shareware sw.grp: it segfaults on startup).

Note #1: There's no way to enable the mouse from the in-game menus. To
enable the mouse, you must run the game at least once to create its
config file (~/.jfsw/sw.cfg), then edit the config file and change
ControllerType to 1. You probably also want to change MouseAimingOn to 1,
for a more modern "mouselook" style of play.

Note #2: The Ambience setting in the Sound Setup menu is permanently
disabled, because the ambience code causes the game to crash.

Note #3: Multiplayer does work (at least for LAN play). See
/usr/doc/jsfw-$VERSION/releasenotes.html for multiplayer usage.

Note #4 (for Slackware 64-bit users): The source includes x86 assembly
code, so can't be built for any non-x86 architecture. If you're using
x86_64, you might (or might not) be able to build jfsw on a 32-bit
Slackware system and install it on x86_64 along with alienBOB's compat32 
packages and get it to run.
