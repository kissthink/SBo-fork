Knights is a simple chess board for KDE 4.

It is a rewrite of the KDE3 Knights. You can play againts computer engines
that support the XBoard protocol (like GnuChess), against anouther player
at the same computer, or on the Free Internet Chess Server. It has
automatic rule checking and some nice animations.
