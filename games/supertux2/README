SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the Super
Mario Bros games for the various Nintendo platforms. Run and jump
through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping on them,
bumping them from below or tossing objects at them, grabbing power-ups
and other stuff on the way.

This is the development snapshot: an unstable version of SuperTux,
meant as a technology preview and for people who are not afraid to
write bug reports. Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress!
