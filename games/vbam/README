Our goal is to improve upon VisualBoyAdvance by integrating the best features
from the various builds floating around. Unfortunately work on the "official"
project seems to have stalled. Independent developers have added excellent
features to VBA, but seem to have done so individually. The source codes for
many of these forks seem to be abandoned, outdated or missing altogether.
We aim to preserve all of the hard work done by these developers to make the
already great VisualBoyAdvance even better!

By default, VBA-M requires gtkglextmm.  However, you can build without the
gui, which drops the GTK dependency chain, by passing BUILD_GTK=no to the
SlackBuild.
