This is an enhanced client for Id Software's legendary Quake II. It focuses
on single-player. Features include rock-solid stability and AMD64 support.

This only installs the Yamagi-Quake2 source port. Before playing it, you
need to copy your Quake2 data files into the appropriate subdirectories of
/usr/share/quake2.  Please refer to the README files in
/usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-4.00/ for details.
