QuakeForge is a source port of id Software's Quake I.

You will need at least pak0.pak to play the shareware version, and pak1.pak
to play the full game. These can be added to either ~/.quakeforge/id1 or
/usr/share/games/quakeforge/id1/.

The binaries to run QuakeForge are as follows: nq-glx (for OpenGL client),
nq-sdl (for SDL client), qw-client-glx (for QuakeWorld OpenGL client), etc.
