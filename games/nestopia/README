Nestopia is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. It strives for
the most accurate emulation possible at the pixel-by-pixel and sample-by-sample
level. It was also one of the inspirations for bsnes.

A 1Ghz CPU and 128MB RAM are required to get the best performance.

Before starting it up, copy the following files from /usr/share/nestopiah/ to
~/.nestopia/:

	* NstDatabase.xml
	* The default input file (nstcontrols)
	* The Disk System BIOS (disksys.rom)

A Disk System BIOS (disksys.rom) is optional and, of course, not included. If
you have one, put it in ~/.nestopia/ too.
