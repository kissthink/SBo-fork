Shotwell is a digital photo organizer for GNOME. It allows the user to import
photos from a digital camera or disk, organize them in various ways, and export
to share with others.

This requires GConf, ORBit2, libgee, libgexiv2, LibRaw, libsoup, libunique, 
vala-12, icu4c, and webkit.

Kernel options CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS and CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_CLASS will likely
need to be disabled before shotwell recognizes the camera.  We hope that
this will be fixed in the next release of Slackware.  :)
