An easy to use cross-platform panoramic imaging toolchain based on
Panorama Tools. With hugin you can assemble a mosaic of photographs
into a complete immersive panorama, stitch any series of overlapping
pictures and much more.

This requires tclap, libpano13 and either wxPython, wxGTK, or wxX11 to build,
and exiftool as well as enblend-enfuse are required for it to run.

This build was only tested with wxPython, so consider that when choosing.
