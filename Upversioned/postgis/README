PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially
enables" the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a
backend spatial database for geographic information systems
(GIS), much like ESRI's SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension.

PostGIS requires PostgreSQL, proj and geos.
