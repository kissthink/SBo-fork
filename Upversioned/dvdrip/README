dvd::rip is a full featured DVD copy program written in Perl.  It provides an
easy to use but feature-rich Gtk+ GUI to control almost all aspects of the
ipping and transcoding process.  It uses the widely known video processing 
swissknife transcode and many other Open Source tools. 

This requires transcode, perl-extutils-depends, perl-extutils-pkgconfig,
perl-glib, perl-cairo, perl-gtk2, perl-event, and perl-libintl.

ffmpeg, lsdvd, ogmtools, mjpegtools, xvid4conf, subtitleripper, and fping 
are optional dependencies available at SlackBuilds.org.
