GRUB2 (the GRand Unified Bootloader)

GNU GRUB is a multiboot boot loader.

If you want to set the size of gfxterm font,
then specify FONT_SIZE=size in the build options.
The default size is 19.

If you want to install grub2 on GPT,
you need to put a BIOS boot partition on GPT.

This requires os-prober, gnu-unifont, and help2man.
