Maatkit is a set of high-quality command-line tools for open-
source databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. The tools
enable power users to do their work more safely and quickly by
relying on tested software instead of scripting things
themselves. The toolkit includes functionality such as table
checksums, a query profiler, and a visual EXPLAIN tool. It
also provides missing features such as checking whether slaves
have the same data as the master.
