ClamTk is a frontend for ClamAV using Gtk2-perl. It is intended to be
an easy to use, light-weight, on-demand scanner for Linux systems. 

This requires clamav and the following perl modules: perl-Date-Calc,
libwww-perl, locale-gettext, perl-net-dns, perl-Find-File-Rule and
perl-gtk2.

The provided queue file (clamtk.sqf) has the complete build order of
everything you need.

If you are using XFCE you may wish to install thunar-sendto-clamtk.
