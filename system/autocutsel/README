Autocutsel tracks changes in the X server's cutbuffer and CLIPBOARD
selection. When the CLIPBOARD is changed, it updates the cutbuffer.
When the cutbuffer is changed, it owns the CLIPBOARD selection.
The cutbuffer and CLIPBOARD selection are always synchronized.

Autocutsel is mostly useful with window managers since most desktop
environments today include their own clipboard managers.
If you dont use a display manager like KDM you can use autocutsel
by adding an entry to your $HOME/.xinitc file using the -fork option.
