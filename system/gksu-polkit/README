gksu-polkit (gksu through policykit)

gksu is a library and application used to ask the user for passwords
to run programs as root. It is not a good option now that we have
PolicyKit. This new version will provide similar functionality to
cover applications which still haven't been patched to use PolicyKit.

This depends on libgee.
