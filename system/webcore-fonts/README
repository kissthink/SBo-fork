The Webcore Fonts package contains:

* Microsoft's Core Fonts for the web
* Microsoft Tahoma
* Microsoft's new fonts for Windows Vista
* Lucida Console

Before installing these, please remove "/etc/fonts/conf.d/60-liberation.conf".
That file causes Slackware to display Liberation fonts in the place of
Microsoft fonts. If you have Microsoft fonts, you don't need the
substitutions.
