MariaDB is a backward compatible, drop-in replacement branch of the
MySQL(R) Database Server.  It includes all major open source storage
engines, including the Aria storage engine.

This conflicts with Slackware's mysql package. Do NOT install both!

If you want to build the embedded mysql server (libmysqld), which
you will need if you plan to (re)build amarok, then run the script
with EMBEDDED=yes in the environment, but be aware that because
mariadb builds this as shared library, applications linking it
will no longer work with Slackware's mysql package.

libevent is an optional dependency of mariadb.
