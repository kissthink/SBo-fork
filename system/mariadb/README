MariaDB is a backward compatible, drop-in replacement branch of the
MySQL(R) Database Server.  It includes all major open source storage
engines, including the Aria storage engine.

This conflicts with Slackware's mysql package. Do NOT install both!

This conflicts with mytop, as MariaDB already ships with its own
version of mytop. Note that mytop requires perl-TermReadKey at
runtime.

If you want to build the embedded mysql server (libmysqld), which
you will need if you plan to (re)build amarok, then run the script
with EMBEDDED=yes in the environment, but be aware that because
mariadb builds this as shared library, applications linking it
will no longer work with Slackware's mysql package.

Note that the default storage engine for InnoDB tables in MariaDB is
XtraDB. If you want to use Oracle's InnoDB plugin, read the notes
in rc.mysqld.

libevent is an optional dependency of mariadb.
