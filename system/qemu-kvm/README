qemu-kvm is a generic and open source virtualizer.  qemu-kvm achieves
near native performances by leveraging the kvm-kmod modules and
executing the guest code directly on the host CPU.  Slackware provides
pre-built 32/64 bit x86 kvm-kmod modules or you can build different
versions with the kvm-kmod package.

While qemu-kvm can virtualize many system guest types (e.g. alpha, arm,
i386, ppc, x86_64, s390, sparc), not all these system guest types utilize
the kvm-kmod modules.  For those system guest types that don't utilize
the kvm-kmod modules, it is recommended to use the qemu package instead
of this qemu-kvm package.

The qemu-kvm SlackBuild renames the primary binary from 'qemu-system-
x86_64' to 'qemu-kvm' so that the qemu SlackBuild won't overwrite it
if both packages are installed on the same host system.  The qemu-kvm
SlackBuild patches the installed udev rules so that you no longer are 
required to use the system group 'kvm' as the default.  The 'users' 
group is set as the default in this SlackBuild.  If you want to use a 
different group, then run the SlackBuild like this:
  KVMGROUP=group sh qemu-kvm.SlackBuild

Don't forget to load the 'kvm-intel' or 'kvm-amd' module (depending on 
your processor) prior to running 'qemu-kvm'.

spice is an optional dependency.
