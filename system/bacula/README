Bacula (Manage backup, recovery) - Client and server

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system admin) to 
manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer data across a network 
of computers of different kinds.  In technical terms, it is a network 
Client/Server based backup program.  Bacula is relatively easy to use and 
efficient, while offering many advanced storage management features that make 
it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design, 
Bacula is scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting 
of hundreds of computers located over a large network.

This script comes with a few options that can be set at build time, one
of which is DATABASE. Supported databases include postgresql/mysql/sqlite3.
By default mysql support is selected, to disable or select another database
the following can be used: DATABASE="" ./bacula.SlackBuild
One more option worth mentioning is BAT, which can be used to enable building
of Bat together with Bacula. By default Bat comes disabled and for now it
only builds on slackware-current because it requires newer QT.

For more information on upgrading from previous version see README.SLACKWARE
that came with this package (which is also installed with the documentation).
