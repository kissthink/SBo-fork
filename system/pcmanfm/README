PCManFM is an extremely fast and lightweight GTK+ based file manager
which features tabbed browsing and a user-friendly interface.

To view icons on PCMan File Manager, include this line to your 
$HOME/.gtkrc-2.0:   gtk-icon-theme-name="Tango"

pcmanfm warns by default when used by root: you can disable the warning
passing a parameter to the build script, BEND_ME_OVER=kthxbai

This requires libfm.  gvfs is an optional runtime dependency.
