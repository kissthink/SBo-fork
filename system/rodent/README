Rodent evolves from Xffm, Xfce's old file manager.
It is a fast, small, and powerful file manager but it could also be
regarded, as the project homepage suggests, as a graphic shell.

The experimental plugins are disabled by default but can be enabled
by passing EXPERIMENTAL=yes to the script, e.g.
EXPERIMENTAL=yes ./rodent.SlackBuild
