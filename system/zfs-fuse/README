ZFS on FUSE/Linux

This project is a port of the ZFS filesystem to FUSE/Linux, done as part
of the Google Summer of Code 2006 initiative.

Currently ZFS-FUSE is configured to use up to 128 MB of RAM, but it can
grow larger with some usage patterns. It's recommended to have a machine
with at least 1 GB of RAM.
