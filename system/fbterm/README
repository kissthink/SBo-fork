FbTerm is a fast terminal emulator for linux with frame buffer device
or VESA video card.

* If you want to use shortcuts under FbTerm as a normal user, see
  the SECURITY NOTES section of the man page for solution.

* To enable FbTerm to redirect /dev/tty0 output to the pseudo terminal
  of current sub-window, see the same man page as above.
