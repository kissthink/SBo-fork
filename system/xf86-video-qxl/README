xf86-video-qxl (X.org spice qxl video driver) 

This X.Org driver provides support for QEMU QXL paravirt video.
It's meant to be used only in your virtualized guests.

Also an Xspice X server can be built, passing the script
XSPICE=yes. This requires the optional dependency spice.
Note that it's still experimental (=unstable)
