virt-manager is a gtk interface that connects to libvirt.

This requires libvirt, GConf, gnome-python, urlgrabber, virtinst, gtk-vnc,
tunctl, rarian and optionally qemu and/or kvm.

If you have networking problems, make sure you have the tun module loaded.

To run virt-manager as a normal user, you need to configure libvirt
to have the correct permissions.  Uncomment the unix_sock_group and
unix_sock_rw_perms in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf and add the user to the
libvirt group
