A console based password storing application using an encrypted XML document as
its database.

Features include (but not limited to):
 * fixed string or regex based search (if compiled with pcre)
 * import/export
 * fuzzy displaying of passwords if you suspect someone might watch your
   monitor
 * multiple keychains per database
 * the usual editing functions
 * compiles and works on *BSD and Linux
 * editline (libedit) and readline support (little bit in favor of editline)
 * clean and simple CLI with command and keychain completion

This requires libbsd.
