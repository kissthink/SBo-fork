Vifm is an ncurses-based file manager with vi-like keybindings. If you
use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files without
having to learn a new set of commands.

The configuration for vifm sits in ~/.vifm, and documentation sits in 
/usr/doc/vifm-$VERSION/vim/doc.

Vim users: A vifm.vim plugin is included in /usr/doc/vifm-$VERSION/vim. 
Read the INSTALL file for usage information.
