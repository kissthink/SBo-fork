libwww-perl - WWW client/server library for perl

This is a set of Perl modules which provides a simple and consistent
application programming interface to the World-Wide Web. The main focus
of the library is to provide classes and functions that allow you to
write WWW clients. The library also contain modules that are of more
general use and even classes that help you implement simple HTTP
servers.

Since version 6, several submodules have been unbundled. Therefore,
this requires perl-html-parser, perl-html-tagset, perl-encode-locale,
perl-uri-escape, perl-http-date, perl-lwp-mediatypes, perl-http-messages,
perl-http-cookies, perl-http-daemon, perl-file-listing,
perl-http-negotiate, perl-net-http, and perl-www-robotrules.
