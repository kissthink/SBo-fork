The HTTP-Message distribution contains classes useful for representing
the messages passed in HTTP style communication.  These are classes
representing requests, responses and the headers contained within them.

This requires perl-lwp-mediatypes, perl-encode-locale, perl-uri-escape,
perl-http-date, perl-html-parser.
