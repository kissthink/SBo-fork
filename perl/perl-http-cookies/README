This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is,
a database of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent
object knows about. Cookies are a general mechanism which server
side connections can use to both store and retrieve information on
the client side of the connection.

This requires perl-http-message, perl-encode-locale, perl-uri-escape,
perl-http-date and perl-html-parser.
