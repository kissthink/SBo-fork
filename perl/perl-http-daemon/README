Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen
on a socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on
it too.

This requires perl-http-message, perl-encode-locale, perl-uri-escape,
perl-http-date and perl-html-parser.
